## Be a JavaFx-Routing Master: Contributing to javafx-routing

---

Here's your ultimate guide to becoming a javafx-routing contributor:

**Need Help Navigating?**

Feeling lost? Don't fret! Create a new issue with the `need-help` label. Clearly explain your challenge and the specific assistance you seek. The friendly javafx-routing community is here to guide you!

**Bug on the Route? Let's Fix It!**

Encountered a bug disrupting your app's flow? Head over to the issues section and create a new one with the `fix-bug` label. To help us squash it efficiently, please provide the following details:

* **Version:** Specify the javafx-routing version you're using.
* **Reproduction Steps:** Detail the exact steps to reproduce the bug.
* **Visual Evidence:** Screenshots or logs showcasing the error are highly appreciated.
* **Sample Project (Optional):** If possible, share a GitHub link to a project that vividly demonstrates the bug.
* **Screen Recording (Optional):** For more complex issues, a screen recording can be incredibly helpful.

**Feature Request: Charting a New Course**

Have a brilliant idea to enhance javafx-routing's navigation capabilities? Fantastic! Create an issue with the `add-feature` label. Clearly describe your vision and its benefits. Consider adding concept art like mockups, images, or even a video to give your proposal a visual edge!

**Ready to Contribute a Feature? Let's Navigate Together!** Ô∏è

Excited to dive into the code and contribute a new feature? Here's your roadmap:

1. **Fork the Project:** Create your own copy of the javafx-routing project on GitHub.
2. **Branch Out:** Start a new branch based on the project's `master` branch. Use a descriptive name following this format: `feature/<your-github-username>-<feature-name>`. For example, if your GitHub username is `mygithub` and the feature is fancy transitions, the branch name would be `feature/mygithub-fancy-transitions`.
3. **Package it Up:** Create a new package under `rahulstech.jfx.routing.feature.<your-github-username>.<feature-name>`. This will house your main code and any related tests.
4. **Test It Out:** Run the existing tests and samples to confirm your code doesn't disrupt existing functionalities.  **Important:** Focus on modifying code within the package you created. Avoid making changes to unrelated parts of the codebase. If your feature requires changes in other modules, create a separate `add-feature` issue first to discuss the broader implications.
5. **Document It Up:** Add clear comments to your code. Additionally, run the `javadoc` Gradle task to guarantee javadoc generation without errors.
6. **Showcase Your Work:** Create a `ReadMe.md` file for your feature. Include a detailed explanation of what your feature does and how to use it.  In the `ReadMe.md`, consider adding your contact information (such as your email address) for future communication if needed. Also, add a sample under the `samples` directory with a new project named `<your-github-username>-<feature-name>-demo`. This sample should demonstrate your feature properly.
7. **Push & Pull:** Push your code to your forked repository and submit a pull request to the main javafx-routing project.

By following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to becoming a valuable asset to the javafx-routing community. Remember, the community is here to support you on your journey to crafting efficient and user-friendly JavaFX applications!
