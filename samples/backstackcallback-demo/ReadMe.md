### Working with Javafx-Routing and Navigation UI

This interactive demo will guide you through essential functionalities of JavaFX routing and navigation UI:

* **Intuitive Tab Navigation:** Effortlessly switch between different screens using convenient tabs.
* **Visually-Driven Transitions:** Navigate seamlessly with screen transitions that reflect their order (forward transitions for lower to higher indexes and vice versa). This animation provides a clear visual cue for the screen hierarchy.
* **Dynamic UI Updates:** The selected tab automatically adapts as you navigate within a screen, ensuring a user-friendly and consistent experience. This interaction is achieved through a powerful `BackstackCallback` mechanism.
