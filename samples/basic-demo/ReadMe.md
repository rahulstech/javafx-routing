## Jumpstart Your JavaFx-Routing Journey: A Basic Demo ##

---

This hands-on demo serves as your launchpad into the exciting world of JavaFx-Routing! Dive in and explore the fundamental building blocks:

* **Craft a Simple Router Configuration XML:**
    - Master the art of defining basic router configuration in XML, laying the groundwork for your application's navigation structure.
* **Implement the RouterContext with Ease:**
    - Extend `BaseRouterContext` to create your custom [`RouterContext`](../../library/src/main/java/rahulstech/jfx/routing/RouterContext.java), the heart of your JFX Routing application. This component orchestrates navigation and state management.
* **Lifecycle Methods: Understanding the Rhythm**
    - Delve into the lifecycle methods of [`LifecycleAwareController`](../../library/src/main/java/rahulstech/jfx/routing/lifecycle/LifecycleAwareController.java), unlocking the power to execute code at specific stages of a destination's lifecycle (creation, showing, hiding, and destruction).

**Ready to Take Flight?**

Fire up the sample by executing the following command in your terminal from the root project directory:

```bash
./gradlew :samples:basic-demo:run
```

Get your hands dirty with JFX Routing and witness the potential to create dynamic and engaging single-scene applications!
