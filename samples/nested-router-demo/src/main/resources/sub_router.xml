<!--
    sub screens are inside a screen of main router which provides animations for screen enter.
    therefore both enter animations, enter animtion of screen containing sub screen and home enter animation of home sub screen,
    will run simultenously which does not feel good. so the home enter animation is disabled for home sub screen using no_op
    animation. this is not a rule but a guideline.
